# COMP3125 Individual Project: Urban Mobility Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes urban mobility trends using data-driven approaches, focusing on:
1. How the time of day affects traffic patterns.
2. The impact of COVID-19 on public transportation ridership.
3. Differences in peak traffic hours on weekdays versus weekends.

The study leverages datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and public transit ridership data spanning pre-, during-, and post-pandemic periods.

---

## Features
- Traffic volume analysis using regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest).
- Public transit ridership trends over time.
- Insights into weekday vs. weekend traffic behaviors.

---

## Dataset Sources
1. **Traffic Volume Dataset**: UCI Machine Learning Repository 
2. **Public Transit Ridership Dataset**: Aggregated monthly ridership data from U.S. transit agencies.

---

## Results
- Predictable rush-hour peaks dominate weekday traffic.
- Weekend traffic shows flatter, more distributed patterns.
- COVID-19 caused a significant decline in public transit ridership, with gradual recovery post-pandemic.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- Regression models for traffic analysis.
- Data aggregation and visualization for public transit trends.

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter Notebook scripts to reproduce the analysis.

## Acknowledgments
- UCI Machine Learning Repository for traffic data.
- Public datasets from U.S. transit agencies for ridership trends.
